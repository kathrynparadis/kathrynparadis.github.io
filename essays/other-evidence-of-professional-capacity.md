*This page presents other evidence of my professional capacity in computer science as required for the [ICS Ph.D. Portfolio](http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/academics/graduate-degree-programs/ph-d-in-ics/#phd-portfolio). This includes all forms of research, teaching, and service to the community and discipline, including professional vita of employment, professional presentations, reviewing of papers for conferences and journals, competitive fellowships or other external funding awards, patents, teaching, service on committees or as graduate student representatives, and letters of reference.*

## 2. Research

### 2.1 ERDL

Designed a Github project which serves to assist the supervisor and I to organize, track and maintain the sensor infrastructure and associated thermal comfort projects. The project bridges electrical engineers, computer scientists, and School of Architecture students research work, in particular facilitating knowledge transfer given the fast turnover due to student graduation. More information can be found under the project's [README](https://erdl.github.io).

### 2.2 PERCEIVE 

Designed a Github project incubator which served to assist faculty and I to host, mentor, track and collaborate 17 independent studies, honors presentations, and capstones at both undergraduate and master's student level. Students are both from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa and the University of Maryland. The various sub-projects share the same goal of my PhD dissertation to predict software vulnerabilities, but range in nature based on student's interest. More information can be found under the project's [README](https://github.com/sailuh/perceive).
