### 1.1 Measured: Student Learning Through Monitoring Existing Buildings’ Energy Use And Occupant Comfort

**Reference:** *Measured: Student Learning Through Monitoring Existing Buildings’ Energy Use And Occupant Comfort*. Meguro, W., Paradis, C. To appear In ARCC 2019 Conference.

**Abstract:** The objectives of this paper are to share the methods and examine the effectiveness of an
extracurricular applied research laboratory’s ability to develop architecture students’ energy and comfort
knowledge through use of hands on tools and computer simulation. While the components themselves are
not novel, their combination is uncommon and contributes an example of a useful, replicable practice. The
atypical method uses a research lab to combine extracurricular in-depth, hands-on environmental systems
education; community engagement on “real world” buildings; paid student research positions; gradual
acquisition of an environmental systems tool kit; and funding from consistent research grants. While the
previous qualities exist in architectural education, studies show they are the exception and not the norm.
The University of Hawaii at Manoa School of Architecture Environmental Research and Design Lab
consistently goes beyond the professional architecture curriculum to deepen students’ knowledge in and
affinity for designing and operating energy efficient, comfortable buildings. The students demonstrate
initiative, skill mastery, and affinity for environmental systems and building technology subjects during their studies and upon graduation in their career selections.

### 1.2 Towards Explaining Security Defects in Complex Autonomous Aerospace Systems

**Reference:** *Towards Explaining Security Defects in Complex Autonomous Aerospace Systems*. Carlos Paradis, Rick Kazman, and Misty D. Davies. AIAA Scitech 2019 Forum. January. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2019-0770

**Abstract:** Current-day autonomous aerospace systems are increasingly being designed with service-
oriented architectures. These architectures make it easy to reconfigure off-the-shelf components and capabilities for new missions and to plug-and-play new capabilities as they are developed. However, such components tend to be assured only in isolation. Validation and verification of the overall system, including the interactions of these components, is likely to rely on a contract-based guarantee approach for the components and runtime verification. Specifying contracts in order to insure overall system performance and safety is a difficult problem. In this paper, we discuss the current gaps towards achieving cybersecurity assurance given these architectures. We also briefly discuss an approach to learning these contracts in order to assure security behavior for the Air Force Research Lab (AFRL)
UxAS use case.

### 1.3 Indexing Text Related to Software Vulnerabilities in Noisy Communities Through Topic Modelling

**Reference:** C. Paradis, R. Kazman and P. Wang, *"Indexing Text Related to Software Vulnerabilities in Noisy Communities Through Topic Modelling,"* 2018 17th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA), Orlando, FL, 2018, pp. 763-768. doi: 10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00121

**Abstract:** Abstract—Despite efforts in the security community to quickly index and disseminate vulnerabilities as they are discovered and addressed, there are concerns about how to scale up the knowledge management of vulnerabilities given its dramatic growth rate. To address these concerns, recent research shifted towards more proactive approaches, in particular leveraging text mining methods to improve vulnerability identification and dissemination to security investigators. While providing a starting point for understanding vulnerability trends, recent methods are still reliant on curated identifiers, such as ‘CVE-\*’, hence missing the majority of cybersecurity activity. We show that we can leverage overlapping textual themes in software vulnerabilities to identify related software vulnerability discussions without prior knowledge of identifiers. Our method obtained 86% accuracy in identifying related vulnerabilities with minimal pre-processing in a noisy community.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Identifying Cybersecurity Software Vulnerabilities from a Defender and Attacker Standpoint: Literature Review

**Reference:** *Identifying Cybersecurity Software Vulnerabilities from a Defender and Attacker Standpoint: Literature Review* Carlos Paradis.

**Abstract:** The goal of this literature review is to discuss the state of the art in helping security and safety analysts preventing software vulnerabilities. The literature suggests two main approaches: The first assumes that the source of vulnerabilities are in the code of an application, and therefore the infrastructure that supports software development can be studied, and potentially augmented to prevent software faults, in particular security bugs. The second assumes that, beyond code, software vulnerabilities are concepts in a programmer’s mind, in particular attackers, that span multiple vulnerabilities independent of a particular software application and it’s infrastructure. Vulnerabilities can therefore be studied in online forums, and social media, and their concepts leveraged to prevent software vulnerabilities even before code is written. Following the two main threads of current and past literature, this literature review discusses what work has been done in these two areas, and proposes research opportunities for future work.

### 3.1 A New Perspective on Predicting Maintenance Costs

**Reference:** Florian Uunk, Rick Kazman, Yuanfang Cai, Noah Black, Carlos Andrade, and Fetsje Bijma. *A New Perspective on Predicting Maintenance Costs*. Technical report, Drexel University, 2012.

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a new approach to correlating file metrics to maintenance effort. We examine the correlations between variations in file metrics and variations in the maintenance effort spent on these files over multiple releases. Because effort data is seldom accurately collected, and is never collected for open source projects, we have employed three novel, broadened and more holistic measures of filelevel maintenance effort: the number of lines of code changed to resolve tasks (churn), the amount of discussion that tasks generated (discussions), and the number of atomic changes made to a file to resolve a task (actions). From the data extracted from multiple Apache projects, we found that a small subset of file metrics were significantly correlated to our effort measures, especially to code churn and actions. The best correlations vary from project to project, suggesting that maintenance effort measurements should be project-specific.
