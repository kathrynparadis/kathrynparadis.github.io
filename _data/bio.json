government’s budget lines and understand where tax money is being spent. My role in the team is to find, explore, pre-process,
and analyze Brazil’s Fiscal Year Budget. Across the promised outcomes, my role more closely relates to help crafting stories, or by
finding and exploring what data is available, help shape the presentation of it through the website and/or API. I am also exploring
in parallel the open spending of Salvador, another city in Brazil and my hometown as both city and state’s budget data availability
