government’s budget lines and understand where tax money was spent. My role in the team was to help write data stories, 
finding and exploring what data was available in existing outdated websites, and help make it available of it through our website and/or API. I also explored
in parallel the open spending of Salvador, another city in Brazil and my hometown as both city and state’s budget data availability.
